npm i superagent // to help us make http calls.

A promise basically implemt the concept of a fuure value that we are expecting to receive sometime
in the future. It is like saying Hey server/api get me the list of customers and let me know when you are ready
and then give me the data back.

The main difference between a callback and promises is that call back makes our code messy and difficult to maintain
but with promises we can chain the promises to one another instead of nesting them like callbacks.

A promise as soon as it comes back with the data is called a resolved promised. In the begining it is a pending promise
and when it successfully gets the data then it becomes a resolved promised.

However a resolved promise might not always be successful because there might have been an error so we say
a resolved promised can either be fulfilled or rejected. 

It is fulfilled when we get the data back but rejected when there is an error. We usually use the method catch
to catch the errors.
